# Prova finale di Reti Logiche
Final project for the course "Reti Logiche" held at Politecnico di Milano (2022/23).

Final vote: 30/30

Language: VHDL

Software used: Vivado

Project by Matteo Lussana ([@matteo-lussana](https://github.com/matteo-lussana)) and Irene Lo Presti ([@irelop](https://github.com/irelop)).


## Aim of the project
Implementation of a HW module that interfaces with RAM memory and that follows the indications given in the requirements.
## Requirements
The system receives information about a memory location whose content must be directed towards one of four available output channels.
Indications are provided via a one-bit serial input, while the system outputs provide all bits of the memory word in parallel.

The specific requirements (written in Italian) [here](/specifica.pdf).

### Note
The diagrams of the state machine and the datapath are available in the [report](/relazione.pdf).
